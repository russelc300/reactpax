Features
Dashboard Overview: Provides a comprehensive view of all rental units, including those that are maintained, vacant, and currently occupied.
Financial Tracking: Monitor and manage variable costs and revenues to maintain up-to-date cash flow analysis.
User Authentication: Secure user authentication system to ensure data integrity and security, reflecting changes in real-time as tenants move in or out.
Payment Processing: Integrates a reliable payment system to handle frequent transactions smoothly, accommodating the high turnover of tenants.
